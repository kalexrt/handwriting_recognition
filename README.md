Doctor's Handwriting Recognition 
Description:

This dataset aims to facilitate research in doctor's handwriting recognition for applications like automated prescription analysis. It consists of handwritten medicine names collected from individuals recruited specifically for this project.

Data Information:

Type: Images of handwritten medicine names
Collection Method: Custom dataset created by recruiting peers to write medicine names
Size: 2500
Data Preprocessing:

Python and shell scripts were used to preprocess the data:
Image resizing: All images were resized to a consistent size of 400x400.
Data cleaning: Text was cleaned and standardized for consistency.


CSV Generation:

A CSV file was generated from the preprocessed images containing:
Image filename
Handwritten text extracted from the image
Usage Instructions:

This dataset can be used for various purposes, including:

Training machine learning models for doctor's handwriting recognition
Evaluating recognition algorithms
Developing applications for prescription analysis
