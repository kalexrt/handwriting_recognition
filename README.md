# Doctor's Handwriting Recognition Dataset

This dataset is designed to support research in the field of doctor's handwriting recognition, specifically for applications such as automated prescription analysis. It includes images of handwritten medicine names, collected from individuals recruited specifically for this project.

## Data Information

**Type:** Images of handwritten medicine names

**Collection Method:** Custom dataset created by recruiting peers to write medicine names

**Size:** 2500 images

## Data Preprocessing

Python and shell scripts were employed for preprocessing the data:

- **Image Resizing:** All images were resized to a consistent size of 400x400 pixels.
- **Data Cleaning:** The text was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency.

## CSV Generation

A CSV file was generated from the preprocessed images containing:

- **Image filename**
- **Handwritten text extracted from the image**

## Usage Instructions

This dataset can be utilized for various purposes, including but not limited to:

- Training machine learning models for doctor's handwriting recognition
- Evaluating handwriting recognition algorithms
- Developing applications for prescription analysis
